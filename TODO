server-side:

    - figure out how to alarm (cron?)
    - implement done calls
    - implement syntax checks
    - persistent notification with working buttons?
    - dbus-next doesn't work with glib dbus mainloops, so gotta 
        figure that out to get proper notifications

client-side:
    
    - implement checks for unnecessary arguments
    - foreground option?
    - local option without involving the server
    - bit of code cleanup
    - simplify usage

general:

    - TEST TEST TEST
