server-side:

    - figure out how to alarm (cron?)
    - implement done calls
    - implement syntax checks
    - persistent notification with working buttons?

client-side:
    
    - implement checks for unnecessary arguments
    - foreground option?
    - local option without involving the server
    - bit of code cleanup
